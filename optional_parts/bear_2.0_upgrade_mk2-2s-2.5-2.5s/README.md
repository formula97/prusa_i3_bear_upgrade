### Introduction

These parts allow you to upgrade your __Full Bear 2.0 MK2(S)/MK2.5(S) frame__ to use similar parts to, and with the same features as, the Bear 2.1 parts. The new Bear 2.1 frame is based on the Full Bear 2.0 MK3 frame which has (some) different extrusion lengths to the Full Bear 2.0 MK2(S)/MK2.5(S) frame.

These parts are __not__ compatible with the __Bear 2.1 frame for Prusa MK2(S)/MK2.5(S)__.



### Printed parts

To confirm that you have a __Full Bear 2.0 MK2(S)/MK2.5(S) frame__, you just need to check the length of the Y axis extrusions.

Measure the length of your Y axis __extrusion__ as shown in the diagram below.
  * If the length is __311 mm__ (±1mm):
    * Then you have a __Full Bear 2.0 MK2(S)/MK2.5(S) frame__.
    * You will need to use these parts: [Download this ZIP file](../../../../releases/latest/download/bear21_optional_parts.zip), STL are in the folder `bear_2.0_upgrade_mk2-2s-2.5-2.5s/printed_parts/stl`.
  * If the length is __331 mm__ (±1mm):
    * Then you have a frame compatible with the Bear 2.1 parts. You do __not__ need to use any of the parts linked above. Download the printed parts from the [links on the main, Bear 2.1, page](../../README.md#printed-parts).

### Print settings

:warning: Warning: It is important to follow the recommended print settings and to **calibrate your extrusion multiplier** before printing the parts (for each and every spool that you use). [Check our calibration guide here](https://guides.bear-lab.com/Guide/Extrusion+multiplier+and+filament+diameter/8).

Use the same print settings as for the Bear Frame 2.1 parts: [link to the print settings](../../doc/print_settings.md).



### Assembly guide

Use the same assembly guide as for the Bear Frame 2.1: [link to the assembly guide](https://guides.bear-lab.com/c/Frame).



### Bill of materials

The BOM is the same as for the Bear Frame 2.1: [link to the bom](../../doc/bom.md).
